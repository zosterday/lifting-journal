# Lifting Journal

Welcome to the **Lifting Journal** project! This repository is designed to help you keep track of your your progress, goals, and personal records on your favorite lifts. Whether you're a seasoned lifter or just starting out, this tool will assist you in maintaining a comprehensive record of your lifts.

## Description

The **Lifting Journal** is a razor pages web application that allows you to log your weight, sets, and repetitions for specific exercises, and track the progress you make and the records you set. It provides an intuitive interface for tracking your performance over time. Whether you're into powerlifting, bodybuilding, or general fitness, this journal will help you stay organized and motivated to reach those goals. There is also a one rep max calculator provided so you can see an estimate of what your max would be based on a weight and rep amount of what you have done. This allows you to estimate what your peak strength would be without the risk of injury of testing an all out single rep max too often.
